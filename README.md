# Word to pdf with dotnet core

Created for document conversion using dotnet core and docker support. 
Used a [resource](https://github.com/smartinmedia/Net-Core-DocX-HTML-To-PDF-Converter.git) to achive that.

## Requirements
 - To use as docker container, you need to install Docker desktop from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

## Installation

 - Clone this repository to local 
 - Navigate your terminal to `src\RestApiExample` folder and run `docker build -t docxconvertor .` command to create docker image.
 - In terminal, use `docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name=docxconvertorcontainer docxconvertor`command to run container from image that just created.
 - In terminal, connect to the running container interactive mode by `docker exec -it docxconvertorcontainer bash`.
 - In interactive mode install libre office using `apt-get update && apt-get -y install libreoffice`
 - Now, you are ready to go. From a client (eg: Postman), you can make post request to `http://localhost:8080/Document/ConvertToPdf` with this body:
```
  {
    "wordBase64": "base64 string of file"
  }
```
